# Fix for "Getting Lost" Company Admin Project Creation Error

## Problem Description
The "Getting Lost" company admin (info@gettinlost.com) is experiencing errors when trying to add projects. This is because they were incorrectly assigned the "manager" role instead of "admin" role when their company was created.

## Root Cause
When the SuperAdmin creates a new company, the company owner should be assigned the "admin" role to have full administrative privileges. However, in some cases during early system setup, company owners were assigned "manager" role instead.

While both "admin" and "manager" roles have database-level permissions to create projects (according to RLS policies), the "admin" role is the proper designation for company owners and ensures they have all necessary administrative permissions.

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Run the Role Fix SQL
Execute the following SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Fix Getting Lost company admin role
UPDATE employees 
SET role = 'admin' 
WHERE email = 'info@gettinlost.com' 
  AND role = 'manager';

-- Verify the change
SELECT id, first_name, last_name, email, role, organization_id
FROM employees 
WHERE email = 'info@gettinlost.com';
```

### Step 2: Test Project Creation
After running the SQL fix:
1. Have the Getting Lost admin log out and log back in
2. Navigate to the Admin Dashboard
3. Try creating a new project
4. The error should now be resolved

### Step 3: Verify Company Structure
Check that the company structure is now correct:

```sql
-- Check Getting Lost company structure
SELECT 
  e.first_name, 
  e.last_name, 
  e.email, 
  e.role,
  o.name as company_name
FROM employees e
JOIN organizations o ON e.organization_id = o.id
WHERE o.name ILIKE '%getting lost%'
ORDER BY e.role DESC;
```

## Prevention for Future Companies
The SuperAdminDashboard has been updated to correctly create company owners with "admin" role. The relevant code shows:

```javascript
// Create employee record as admin (company owner)
const { error: employeeError } = await supabase
  .from('employees')
  .insert({
    // ... other fields
    role: 'admin',  // ✅ Correctly set to admin
    // ... other fields
  })
```

## Additional Benefits of Admin Role
Company owners with "admin" role can:
- ✅ Create and manage projects
- ✅ Add/edit/remove employees  
- ✅ Configure company settings
- ✅ Access all reports and analytics
- ✅ Manage company locations
- ✅ Configure expense settings

## Verification Commands
After applying the fix, you can verify everything is working:

```sql
-- 1. Confirm role change
SELECT email, role FROM employees WHERE email = 'info@gettinlost.com';

-- 2. Test project creation permissions (should return true)
SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM employees 
      WHERE email = 'info@gettinlost.com' 
      AND role = 'admin'
    ) THEN 'Can create projects ✅'
    ELSE 'Cannot create projects ❌'
  END as project_permissions;
```
